# Expandable-DJS-Bot
Expandable-DJS-Bot (herein, EDB) is a basic outline of a Discord.js discord-bot with some barebones structure and features. 

EDB allows for developers to add their own commands to an already structured discord bot, as well for users to be able to just install the required dependacies, fill in a few configurations and launch. 

## Setting Up

In order to learn how to set up and deploy the bot, please check out the wiki page [here](https://github.com/angelicaldev/expandable-djs-bot/wiki/Getting-Started), or the GETTING_STARTED.md file in the wiki directory.
